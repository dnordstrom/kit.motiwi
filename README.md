! MOtiwi, a theme and plugin kit for TiddlyWiki5

This kit includes jQuery and Semantic UI plugins, and a MOtiwi theme and plugin, as well as build scripts to generate TiddlyWiki5. The build scripts are modified versions of the default `bld.sh`â€”one for encrypted wikis.

!! Usage

Specify domain if necessary in `build.sh`, and build a wiki by running `./build.sh`. By default, it generates the wiki in a `./build` directory. You may specify another directory by running `TW5_BUILD_OUTPUT=../example.com ./build.sh`.

Build an encrypted wiki by running `TW5_PASSWORD=password ./build_secure.sh`.
